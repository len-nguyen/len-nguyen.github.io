summary: All the projects and knowledge I've gathered during my college years

Over the two years I've been attending at UH Manoa, there wasn't that much projects I have worked on in the course with the majority of my learning coming from quizes and homework. During the languages taught like Java and SQL, I wished they had given mini projects for us students to work on to deepen our understating of the language to help prepare us. But learning C and C++ was challenging as it gave me a hard time how I should implement my database and if it's even going to work. Constantly facing simple and minor bugs to seeing a whole list of errors taught me that I should keep my work nice and clean and keep it detailed as possible so when others look at my code they can understand how it works no problem. In the end, I still never got a good grade out of it but it made me not haphazardly go straight into coding and understand if I know what it's actually doing. Overall, I wish there was more projects that students can experience and do as it let's them have the creativity while also applying their knowledge that they gained from the class.
