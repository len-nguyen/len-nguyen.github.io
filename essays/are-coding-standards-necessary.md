## Can They Make You A Better Programmer
When learning a new language or using the same language, the most important thing to remember is how you properly format the code. There are a bunch of ways one can make their code better by implementing some of these coding standards. Like the spacing betweenn curly brackets or how maybe there needs to be some consistency for the variables you make in a function, etc. These types of coding standards can provide benefits to the overall code. It could potentially reduce the risk of failure, easy readability for others, better efficiency, and many more! 

## Experience With Coding Standards
Starting off using ESLint with IntelliJ was rough. There was just a stream of red errors because I never put a space inbetween a parenthesis and curly bracket, forgetting that a variable I assigned was never used and other things. It is nice that ESLint can fix those things for you with a click of a button but I thought it 
was a pain having it doing it one at a time until I realized just recently that there was a option of doing it all at once and made my mood better now I don't need to waste time fixing each error one by one. It's really nice to have ESLint show me where my errors are so fixing problems can be easier but too bad it doesn't solve my coding skills as I tend to forget how to properly use the arrow function combined with underscore.
