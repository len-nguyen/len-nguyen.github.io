## Benefits of Using UI Frameworks?

UI Frameworks is software tools used for building software programs to run on the web enabling developers to build beautiful, responsive multi-device applicaition without deep technical knowledge. But why bother with using a framework than just pure html? Well there comes some benefits but also cons when using certain UI Frameworks like Semantic UI. Starting off with the best point of Semantic UI is that it's very easy to use. Like when you want three columns you would just type "three columns" and it's done, it made three equal length columns for you to customize. Or maybe you want a dropdown menu so you can just type "dropdown" and it right there ready to use. Other pros also include less time to develop a page and the wide variety of themes availble for it. Now let's go on with the bad part UI Frameworks. Some UI Frameworks have missing options that maybe another UI Frameworks have but they also don't have something like Semantic UI where it does not have the carousel option to make a slide show with arrows so you would instead have to use pure html to incorporate that into your development. It may be a minor thing but I feel that option is very useful for shopping sites where you would want to show off the products in a nice clean way instead of static pictures. Another problem is you're not learning to code as most of the code is in the documentation of the UI Frameworks and the most you would have to do is just change the inside a little and maybe the styling and that's it. But overall, there are different types of options to choose from for UI Frameworks and it all depends on what they prefer.
