## Benefits of Using UI Frameworks?

UI Frameworks is software tools used for building software programs to run on the web enabling developers to build beautiful, responsive multi-device applicaition without deep technical knowledge. But why bother with using a framework than just pure html? Well there comes some benefits but also cons when using certain UI Frameworks like Semantic UI. Starting off with the best point of Semantic UI is that it's very easy to use. Like when you want three columns you would just type "three columns" and it's done, it made three equal length columns for you to customize. Or maybe you want a dropdown menu so you can just type "dropdown" and it right there ready to use. Other pros also include less time to develop a page and the wide variety of themes availble for it. Now let's go on with the bad part UI Frameworks. Some UI Frameworks have missing options that maybe another UI Frameworks have but they also don't have something like Semantic UI where it does not have the carousel option to make a slide show with arrows so you would instead have to use pure html to incorporate that into your development. It may be a minor thing but I feel that option is very useful for shopping sites where you would want to show off the products in a nice clean way instead of static pictures. Another problem is you're not learning to code as most of the code is in the documentation of the UI Frameworks and the most you would have to do is just change the inside a little and maybe the styling and that's it. But overall, there are different types of options to choose from for UI Frameworks and it all depends on what they prefer.

## My Experience With Semantic UI
Having experience different types of coding standards in other classes, I felt that they were worse because so me where not automated so I would have to manually check each line and see if they were up to standards or maybe I would get random errors for nothing. Now experiencing ESlint had made those problems go away for me but there were some hiccups. Starting off using ESLint with IntelliJ was really rough for me. There was just a stream of red errors because I never put a space inbetween a parenthesis and curly bracket, forgetting that a variable I assigned was never used and other things. It is nice that ESLint can fix those things for you with a click of a button but I thought it 
was a pain having it doing it one at a time until I realized just recently that there was a option of doing it all at once and made my mood better now I don't need to waste time fixing each error one by one. It's really nice to have ESLint show me where my errors are so fixing problems can be easier but too bad it doesn't solve my coding skills as I tend to forget how to properly use the arrow function combined with underscore and which underscore to use because there's way to much.
Getting the green check mark is useful because it tells me that there no missing semicolon inside a potentially large amount of code and having hours trying to find it when all I got to do is go to the line it tells me it's missing and add it in. Overall, using ESLint made my life easier and I hope I'm able to work with more coding standards to keep my code nice and clean.
