## First Impressions on JavaScript 

When I had started the codecamp, I'd felt that I kept reapeating myself in the same language as Java over and over on the questions until I got sick of it. It was then I finally found something different which peaked my interest because if I wanted to become a software engineer in the future I gotta atleast know my stuff. I really liked how I didn't have to use int,str,arrays,objects anymore since it came in a all-in-one package called "var" which I felt made coding nice to have as it was a quality of life thing for me.
Until I realized that there were variations to var that are used much more frequently being "let" and "const", but it didn't make that much of a difference since var is used globally whether it's in the function or class while let and const are local and within. But comparing Java and JavaScript on variables, I would say that JavaScript is a definite winner to me. When looking
at other languages, like Java for example, it uses a OOP scripting language while JavaScript is a OOP programming language. So this means Javascript runs on browser only, while Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser.
