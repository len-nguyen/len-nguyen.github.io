## What Is A Smart Question?

When in need of looking for a solution to your suffering of errors in programming, you would ask others for help and that's what Stack Overflow is there for. Simply just asking for help may not get you the answer that you were seeking for and that's because the way to asked and presented the question to the world of programmers willing to help. But what's the difference between a "smart" question vs to a "not smart" question. Well if you look at [How to Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond, he discusses the key differences between asking someone a smart question vs dumb questions. Like have you done x, y, z before and still have no luck solving your problem, was it clear what was your problem, were the headers part of the problem. Those types of things that you put in the your questions are way more likely to have it answered and even more correctly, even a simple greeting and thank you can come a long way of someone answering your question that you've been struggling on for the past 6 hours. Now lets look at some differences between what "smart" and "not smart" questions look like.

## Smart vs. Not Smart

Looking at this [smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/364952/jquery-javascript-accessing-contents-of-an-iframe), the one posting the question clearly states what kind of language/program that they are currently having trouble with in the header so it lets anyone who is proficient in the language can help more easily. After he goes into more detail on what they needed and even showed their code to let people know that it was worked on. Then later states what the output was and if there were any errors so people answering don't need to recreate the problem and have a different answer. But there are way's to make this question even better than is. Maybe a simple "thank you" and "hello" with a bit clearer formatting that can go a long way but there are alot of good people willing to help others in need.
