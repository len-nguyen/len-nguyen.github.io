## Am I Coding The Smart Way or The Wrong Way?

When starting off as a beginner programmer or a student wanting to learn the wonders of programming, you would often have to face with repetitive or redundant coding and wonder to yourself if this can be improved upon to mitigate the redundancy and make it more flexible. Well.... that's what a design pattern is! The formal definition of a design pattern in software engineering is that it is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. While a design pattern isn't a finished design that can be just a plug in solution to any code but more of a description or template for solving the problem that can be used in different situations. Now that you know what a design pattern is, lets look at if your code is using it. Is the code able to speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms or does it prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems that improves code readability? If the answer is yes then your coding the smart way and there many other ways that design pattern can be utilized in coding. Design patterns can also be split up into three different types being creational, structural, and behavioral where creational is all about class instantiation, structural is about Class and Object composition, and behavioral is about Class's objects communication. Now that we know the general overview of design patterns lets look into examples of how its used in everyday coding!
