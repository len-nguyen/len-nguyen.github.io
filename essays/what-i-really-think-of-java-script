## First Impressions on JavaScript 

When I had started the codecamp, I'd felt that I kept reapeating myself in the same language as Java over and over on the questions until I got sick of it. It was then I finally found something different which peaked my interest because if I wanted to become a software engineer in the future I gotta atleast know my stuff. I really liked how I didn't have to use int,str,arrays,objects anymore since it came in a all-in-one package called "var" which I felt made coding nice to have as it was a quality of life thing for me.
Until I realized that there were variations to var that are used much more frequently being "let" and "const", but it didn't make that much of a difference since var is used globally whether it's in the function or class while let and const are local and within. But comparing Java and JavaScript on variables, I would say that JavaScript is a definite winner to me. When looking
at other languages, like Java for example, it uses a OOP scripting language while JavaScript is a OOP programming language. So this means Javascript runs on browser only, while Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser.

## Is it Good or Bad?



## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
