## What's Interesting About Software Engineering In The First Place?

Well.... everything! When it comes to jobs opportunity, I feel that the jobs that software engineering provides are more suited to me compared to what other jobs that computer science offeres me. If I'm going to be doing a job
for the next 50 years or so I should have something that interests me and that is software engineering. What makes software engineering interesting to me is that if I'm working on a personal project, that means building from the ground up and it gives
me the flexibility to create something that I envision that was just a random idea that came in my head and thought "hmm... that might be cool to have". Or when joining a company and as technology continues to further advance there's going
to need something to utilize that technology and build a software that get's used by real people and making their lives easier. Just having the thrill of problem solving and simply building things are something that makes me
look forward in software engineering. 

## Skills Needed For The Future

Currently, my skills in software engineering or in computer science is subpar as I still don't know anything to come that I would need in software engineering in general. When it comes to coding languages, I would love to at least learn the basic of all the different languagees since I only know 5 but that can be easily improved in the future. Teamwork and attention to detail is the most important because not always that I'm not going to be working in a group so having good collaboration skills along with attention to detail allows the group work to be stronger and finish deadlines faster. Employing math, science, engineering, design techniques to be able to build these systems then I have be motivated to learn these skills to further progress my career if I want to be a software engineer.
