## What's Interesting About Software Engineering In The First Place?

Well.... everything! When it comes to jobs opportunity, I feel that the jobs that software engineering provides are more suited to me compared to what other jobs that computer science offeres me. If I'm going to be doing a job
for the next 50 years or so I should have something that interests me and that is software engineering. What makes software engineering interesting to me is that if I'm working on a personal project, that means building from the ground up and it gives
me the flexibility to create something that I envision that was just a random idea that came in my head and thought "hmm... that might be cool to have". Or when joining a company and as technology continues to further advance there's going
to need something to utilize that technology and build a software that get's used by real people and making their lives easier. Just having the thrill of problem solving and simply building things are something that makes me
look forward in software engineering.
