## What's Interesting About Software Engineering In The First Place?

Well.... everything! When it comes to jobs opportunity, I feel that the jobs that software engineering provides are more suited to me compared to what other jobs that computer science offeres me. If I'm going to be doing a job
for the next 50 years or so I should have something that interests me and that is software engineering. What makes software engineering interesting to me is that if I'm working on a personal project, that means building from the ground up and it gives
me the flexibility to create something that I envision that was just a random idea that came in my head and thought "hmm... that might be cool to have". Or when joining a company and as technology continues to further advance there's going
to need something to utilize that technology and build a software that get's used by real people and making their lives easier. Just having the thrill of problem solving and simply building things are something that makes me
look forward in software engineering. 

## Is it Good or Bad?

Honestly, I think it's a good language to put in your arsenal and if you already know Java then JavaScript shouldn't differ that much and could possibly be easier by not worrying about syntax errors and variables. It offers different types of jobs like web application development and front-end development. Even if this is the first time coding, it starts off easy with learning the basics with a fun and interactive UI and won't make you want to bang your head on the keyboard because of simple errors like forgetting semicolons. JavaScript is a great language to learn at the start to introduce you but learning other languages can help develop your knowledge in coding.

## Is Athletic Software Engineering Really For Me?
<img class="ui small left floated image" src="../images/thinking.png"> 
Practing in Athletic Software Engineering is a good thing for us college students since it 
helps prepare what we will have to do in the future like job interviews where they would ask to write something in pseudocode and explain it within a time limit. Personally, I find it sometimes stressful because I would take most of my time understanding the problem and how should I approach it before I even touch my keyboard and start to panic how much time I have left. But the real world doesn't wait for you, so getting used to being under pressure helps us in the long run where our dream job is right there but your having a hard time solving a problem in the time limit. Hopefully I can get better at pacing myself in future problems to prevent myself from panicing for not even starting the code when I only have a minute left.
