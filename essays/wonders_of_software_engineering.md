Throughout the semester of ICS 314, I've learned a lot when it comes to Software Engineering and what it has to offer in the future as I am interested to make it my career. Teaching what the expect from real world scenarios like Athletic Software Engineering where you have to complete a task in a certain amount of time to mimic what it will be like in interviews. Learning Agile Project Management and Coding Standards have helped me working in group projects that allowed every member to work efficiently as if it was a real job.

## Standards of Coding Ethics

Coding Ethics was the one thing that never came to mind when programming and learning about it in class about whether to delete facebook based on their coding ethics made me think a lot about how companies will often break these ethics to know the user activity and suit their program better towards them. After reading the ACM Code of Ethics, it helped me understand that if there is a reason these companies are breaking these ethics for a good program or application because they want it to be more suited to their consumers but another problem with that is there can be data leaks that these companies potentiality have. But overall learning about coding ethics is something to keep in mind when building a program or application.

## Agile Project Management

This was another super important concept that I feel I learned from this class because, not only does it apply to Software Engineering, but it can be applied to almost any other group based project because the concept is essentially the same, the idea to plan out an idea from the customersâ€™ perspectives then applying issue-driven project management, it makes it a lot easier to put a project together because by utilizing a project board on GitHub, each team member are aware of what issues each other is working on, and thus it can help the flow of the project because as a team member, this functionality allows us to gauge what issue should be work on next or what issue should be added and having everything in one place is also a plus. After experiencing this management system, I honestly think I would consider using this concept when working on other group projects and perhaps even suggesting to my group to use GitHub or something with similar functionality because of how efficient it is having all of our issues and idea in one place.

## Coding Standards

I believe coding standard is absolutely necessary when working with any type of code as it so important to keep the code clean for you and others to look at. But what is a coding standard anyway? It can have a bunch of ways one can make their code better by implementing some of these coding standards. Like the spacing between curly brackets or how maybe there needs to be some consistency for the variables you make in a function, etc. These types of coding standards can provide benefits to the overall code. It could potentially reduce the risk of failure, easy readability for others, better efficiency, and many more! As I was working on the final project, I felt having a coding standard made our group work easier because if one person was having trouble and asked for help then the other person would have a easier ime reading the code and know what it's supposed to do and can find a answer to the problem.
